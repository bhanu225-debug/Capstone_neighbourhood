Is it a high-end fine dining restaurant or casual style dinner or a specific type of cuisine in mind such as French, Italian or Indian.Choosing a restaurant located in a busy area with plenty of foot traffic, or is there enough parking or are there any other restaurants opened or closed in the same spot?We will focus on the types of different restaurants which are opened or closed in a particular place and then decide if it is a good place to open a new restaurant based on the popular cuisine around that place. Here,I have considered south Mumbai as the location to open restaurant. So, Let\u2019s explore Neighbourhoods of the south Mumbai."

From the geographical presentation of the clusters, we can say that there is a scope to open a new restaurant in the Cuffe Parade area.\n2. From the results, we can suggest that opening a new Indian restaurent at C.G.S. colony,Antop Hill .\n3. It can also be suggested that opening a Fast food restaurant at Malabar Hill .\n\n# Conclusion\nAs the analysis is performed on a small set of data, we can achieve better results by increasing the neighbourhood information. Mumbai has scope to expand different types of restaurants at different places. Based on the current results it can be observed that the South Mumbai has many different types of new restaurant business to offer. It can also be explored further with careful consideration of neighbourhoods at the western and Eastern suburbs.\n"
